# Python Assignment - Ceren Ordas

### Due: 6 May 2022

- In this repository with files needed to complete the Python Assignment, the README.md file will give information about all these files one by one.

- BCB546-PythonHW_Spring2022-Ceren_Ordas.ipynb file is the markdown file showing code for each step of the assignment (1-11). Every step, line by line was documented very clearly to the best of my abilities, so that I could keep track of my progress (I might've overdone it).
 
- sequence_translate.py consists of the code provided by Dr. X with some functions, and instructions on how to complete the assignment. 

- penguins_cytb.fasta file consists of the nucleotide sequences for each of the penguin species.

- penguins_mass.csv consists of the .csv file with a column showing the names of the species and a column showing the mass of the species.

- penguins_mass_cytb.csv consists of the new csv file of the new data frame I created as a part of the assignment.

Thank you!
